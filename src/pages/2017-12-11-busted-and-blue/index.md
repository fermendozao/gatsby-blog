#### a song by Gorillaz | Damon Albarn

Where does it come from? <br/>
When everything was outside <br/>
Busted and blue <br/>
How in the universe <br/>
Through the lithium <br/>
Busted and blue <br/>
I was asked by a computer <br/>
A shadow on the wall <br/> 
An image made by Virgil <br/>
To rule over us all <br/>
To amplify the sirens <br/>
And to find real amends <br/>
I'm through the echo-chambers <br/>
To other worlds away <br/>
All my life <br/>
All my life <br/>
Beam a light <br/>
On me, I am a satellite <br/>
And I can't get back without you <br/>
Be my love <br/>
Be my love <br/>
Be my love <br/>
Be my love <br/>
Where do they come from? <br/>
The wires that connect to us <br/>
Weightless and fall on your body <br/>
'Till we're invisible <br/>
I'm with you throughout it, choose <br/>
Busted and blue <br/>
All my life <br/>
All my life <br/>
Beam a light <br/>
On me, I am a satellite <br/>
And I can't get back without you <br/>
Be my love <br/>
Be my love <br/>
Be my love <br/>
Be my love <br/>
Busted and blue <br/>
